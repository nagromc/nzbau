These two scripts allow Synology users to automatically repair and unpack NZB 
downloads from DSM's Download Station.

To run properly, you need to execute nzbau_jobchecker.sh AND nzbau_unpacker.sh.
The second script will unpack the "raw downloads" detected by the first one.

You can edit nzbau.conf to configure the scripts.
